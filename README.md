# Python_Diwali_Sales_Data_Analysis
In this project, I have done the data analysis on the basis of Diwali Sales Dataset in Jupyter Notebook.

Libraries used: Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn

1) Performed Data Cleaning and manipulation using Pandas.
2) Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and seaborn.
3) Improved Customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
4) Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
